# SketchLeagueBot
Bot that plays Sketch League written in Python using pyautogui

<h2>Implementation Details</h2>

Coded entirely in Python using the popular module, pyautogui. The bot scrapes the website for the image and downloads it. It processes the image into a lower resolution with colours available in sketch league. It then draws each pixel rapidly (roughly 100 pixels/second). 

Make sure to set the brushsize to 1 tick above the small option before running the bot. The bot will start by alt-tabbing so make sure that the browser with sketch league is the last visited screen (so alt-tab will switch to it).
